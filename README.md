# Hackathon-2022
This was our hackathon submission for HYL 2022


This was a partner hackathon and was done with Manraj Singh. The concept behind this was too create a code project that would be able to teach people about coding. We decided to create this using Java that would teach people about java. It's not fully complete but has most of the basic components behind it.


You would need to launch the Interface Class and continue from there to see how the project works, it has a login page, a couple lessons and quizzes to go along with these lessons that give right and wrong answers. And you are able to watch more videos through the links in the pages. It could use a couple updates, but has most of the fundamentals so far.
